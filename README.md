# Hexagon
Hexagon is a fast-paced C++ board/arcade game inspired by tactical hex-grid games and reflex-based arcade mechanics.
Players take turns moving pieces on a hexagonal board to capture tiles â€” the project includes local 1v1 multiplayer, singleplayer vs bot, and a best-score viewer that stores top results in a text file.

# Features

- Implemented in C++ using SFML for windowing and rendering.
- Local Multiplayer (Human vs Human) and Singleplayer (Human vs Bot) modes.
- Simple AI that evaluates available moves and selects high-value options.
- Visual board made of hexagon tiles with color-based ownership and capture mechanics.
- Best scores are saved and displayed from bestScore.txt.
- Clean object-oriented code structure (window management, hexagon objects, game logic).
